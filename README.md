# Overview
I wanted to create a Simple and Accurate Search using the GiphyApi. Using a basic layout i didn't want there to be to many things going on overwhelming the user

# User Stories
As a User i want a fun website so i can have a source of entertainment

As a returning user i want a more interactive website so i can stay entertained for a longer period of time

As a User i want to be able to quickly access giphs so i can share them on social media

# Future Improvements
I would like to make the website more uniform. Including a random button that displays random Giphs if the user wants some inspiration. I would also like to make the website more interactive to keep the User continuosly interested in the Website for a longer period of time.
